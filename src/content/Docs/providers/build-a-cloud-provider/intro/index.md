Akash Network offers a decentralized cloud marketplace where users can lease compute resources in a permissionless and open environment. As an Akash provider, you can contribute your compute resources to the network and earn revenue by hosting workloads for tenants.

## Getting Started

There are two primary ways to become an Akash provider:

1. **Using the Akash CLI:** This method provides full control over your provider setup and operations, allowing for advanced configurations and automation.
2. **Using the Akash Web App:** This is a more user-friendly approach, enabling providers to onboard quickly without requiring extensive command-line knowledge.

Both methods allow you to register your resources, set pricing, and accept deployment requests from tenants looking for cloud compute power.

Becoming an Akash provider helps decentralize cloud computing while allowing you to monetize unused compute capacity. Whether you choose the CLI or the web app, the process is designed to be straightforward and accessible to a wide range of users.
